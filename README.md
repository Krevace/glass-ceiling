Glass Ceiling
=======================
Developed for the VT HackViolet Hackathon in around 15 hours. The Hackathon had no theme, though suggestions included female empowerment and social good. So, my teammate [Tyler](https://github.com/tylerlusczek) and I decided to make "Glass Ceiling", a web-app similar to Glass Door but instead focused on spreading awareness of the issue of the wage gap between genders. The final version shown to the Hackathon judges was [here](https://github.com/Krevace/glass-ceiling/tree/25ecc3adcde4344df70b203394ba26a76d0dcaba).

We spent most of the first half of the Hackathon learning how we would possibly make a website, as neither of us had any experience, though I had worked with MongoDB before in the past. By the end, we had a basic understanding of Express.js, Node.js, and Pug. We also used sahat's [Hackathon Starter Template](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter), which heavily held our hands in setting up the project and teaching us the fundumentals. We're pretty satisfied with the end result.

If we were to make some changes in the future, we'd give the company pages some flair instead of just displaying the salary data in plaintext. An autocomplete feature on the home page would've also served the project well. And a much needed optimization would be to add company collections to the database, so we wouldn't have to query the entire userbase whenever a company is searched up. But it's a hackathon, cut us some slack,  maybe we can revisit these potential features in the future.

The website was hosted on [render](https://render.com) for the competition, but has since been taken down.
